SGD in pure Python
-------------------
Developed a simple neural network using stochastic gradient descent for optimization in pure python. I trained and evaluated my model on a dataset containing various wine qualities.

Dataset 
------------------- 
The model was trained/tested on a [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality) from UCI containing 11 features and quality score between 0-10.

* 1 - fixed acidity
* 2 - volatile acidity
* 3 - citric acid
* 4 - residual sugar
* 5 - chlorides
* 6 - free sulfur dioxide
* 7 - total sulfur dioxide
* 8 - density
* 9 - pH
* 10 - sulphates
* 11 - alcohol
* Output variable (based on sensory data):
* 12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
